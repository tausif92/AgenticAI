    "### Corrective RAG\n",
    "- Corrective RAG (often called Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a new pattern in RAG systems where the model not only retrieves documents but detects, corrects, and rewrites bad retrieval results before generating the final answer.\n",
    "- Think of it as RAG + Error Correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Definition\n",
    "- Corrective RAG is a workflow where the system evaluates retrieved documents, identifies irrelevant or incomplete information, corrects the retrieval by rewriting or reframing the query, retrieves again, and only then generates the final answer.\n",
    "- It fixes retrieval failures before the answer is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Corrective RAG?\n",
    "Normal RAG fails in these cases:\n",
    "- retrieval returns irrelevant documents\n",
    "- retrieved chunks don’t contain the necessary information\n",
    "- the query is ambiguous\n",
    "- user provides insufficient details\n",
    "In standard RAG → The model still tries to answer and hallucinates.\n",
    "Corrective RAG → The system detects the problem and fixes the retrieval loop, improving precision drastically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Corrective RAG Works (High-Level)\n",
    "Corrective RAG usually involves 3 intelligent components:\n",
    "1. Retriever\n",
    "    Fetches initial documents.\n",
    "2. Evaluator / Grader\n",
    "    Checks:\n",
    "    - Are documents relevant?\n",
    "    - Are they complete enough?\n",
    "    - Do they answer the question?\n",
    "    If “No”: send to corrective step.\n",
    "3. Corrector / Rewriter\n",
    "    Improves:\n",
    "    - search query\n",
    "    - missing details\n",
    "    - user question rewrite\n",
    "    - constraints  \n",
    "    Then re-runs retrieval.\n",
    "4. Generator\n",
    "    Produces the final answer only when evaluator accepts the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔄 Corrective RAG Loop (Flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "User Question  \n",
    "     ↓  \n",
    "Retrieval  \n",
    "     ↓  \n",
    "Evaluator (Are docs relevant?)  \n",
    "     ↓ Yes               ↓ No  \n",
    "Final Answer       Rewriter → Retrieve Again  \n",
    "\n",
    "This continues until grader says \"documents OK\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "User asks:  \n",
    "    “Explain how vector databases work.”  \n",
    "Retriever returns:\n",
    "- vector embeddings intro\n",
    "- similarity search\n",
    "- irrelevant chunk about SQL indexes  \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluator says: ❌ documents are not relevant enough.  \n",
    "Corrector rewrites the query to:  \n",
    "    “How do vector databases work? Include embedding storage, approximate nearest neighbor search, and indexing.”  \n",
    "Retriever fetches better documents.  \n",
    "Evaluator says: ✔️ documents relevant.  \n",
    "Generator produces final answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corrective RAG in LangGraph\n",
    "Your own workflow matches Corrective RAG:\n",
    "- retrieve → evaluate → rewrite → retrieve → evaluate → generate  \n",
    "The grade_documents function in your graph is exactly the evaluator.  \n",
    "If it returns \"rewrite\", the system fixes retrieval before generating the final answer.  \n",
    "This is classic Corrective RAG.\n"

You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:\\n\\n\\nState: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any data type, but is typically defined using a shared state schema.\\n\\n\\nNodes: Functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current state as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated state.\\n\\n\\nEdges: Functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current state. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.\\n\\n\\nBy composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the state over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that state.\\nTo emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than functions – they can contain an LLM or just good ol’ code.\\nIn short: nodes do the work, edges tell what to do next.\\nLangGraph’s underlying graph algorithm uses message passing to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired by Google’s Pregel system, the program proceeds in discrete “super-steps.”\\nA super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an inactive state. A node becomes active when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or “channels”). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to halt by marking themselves as inactive. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are inactive and no messages are in transit.\\n\\u200bStateGraph\\nThe StateGraph class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined State object.\\n\\u200bCompiling your graph\\nTo build your graph, you first define the state, you then add nodes and edges, and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed?\\nCompiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like checkpointers and breakpoints. You compile your graph by just calling the .compile method:\\nCopyAsk AIgraph = graph_builder.compile(...)\\n\\nYou MUST compile your graph before you can use it.\\n\\u200bState\\nThe first thing you do when you define a graph is define the State of the graph. The State consists of the schema of the graph as well as reducer functions which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the State will be the input schema to all Nodes and Edges in the graph, and can be either a TypedDict or a Pydantic model. All Nodes will emit updates to the State which are then applied using the specified reducer function.\\n\\u200bSchema\\nThe main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using a TypedDict. If you want to provide default values in your state, use a dataclass. We also support using a Pydantic BaseModel as your graph state if you want recursive data validation (though note that Pydantic is less performant than a TypedDict or dataclass).\\nBy default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the guide for more information.\\n\\u200bMultiple schemas\\nTypically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this:\\n\\nInternal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph’s input / output.\\nWe may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.\\n\\nIt is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, PrivateState.\\nIt is also possible to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define an “internal” schema that contains all keys relevant to graph operations. But, we also define input and output schemas that are sub-sets of the “internal” schema to constrain the input and output of the graph. See this guide for more detail.\\nLet’s look at an example:\\nCopyAsk AIclass InputState(TypedDict):\\n    user_input: str\\n\\nclass OutputState(TypedDict):\\n    graph_output: str\\n\\nclass OverallState(TypedDict):\\n    foo: str\\n    user_input: str\\n    graph_output: str\\n\\nclass PrivateState(TypedDict):\\n    bar: str\\n\\ndef node_1(state: InputState) -> OverallState:\\n    # Write to OverallState\\n    return {\"foo\": state[\"user_input\"] + \" name\"}\\n\\ndef node_2(state: OverallState) -> PrivateState:\\n    # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState\\n    return {\"bar\": state[\"foo\"] + \" is\"}\\n\\ndef node_3(state: PrivateState) -> OutputState:\\n    # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState\\n    return {\"graph_output\": state[\"bar\"] + \" Lance\"}\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(OverallState,input_schema=InputState,output_schema=OutputState)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_1\", node_1)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_2\", node_2)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_3\", node_3)\\nbuilder.add_edge(START, \"node_1\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_1\", \"node_2\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_2\", \"node_3\")\\nbuilder.add_edge(\"node_3\", END)\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile()\\ngraph.invoke({\"user_input\":\"My\"})\\n# {\\'graph_output\\': \\'My name is Lance\\'}\\n\\nThere are two subtle and important points to note here:\\n\\n\\nWe pass state: InputState as the input schema to node_1. But, we write out to foo, a channel in OverallState. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node can write to any state channel in the graph state. The graph state is the union of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes OverallState and the filters InputState and OutputState.\\n\\n\\nWe initialize the graph with:\\nCopyAsk AIStateGraph(\\n    OverallState,\\n    input_schema=InputState,\\n    output_schema=OutputState\\n)\\n\\nSo, how can we write to PrivateState in node_2? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the StateGraph initialization?\\nWe can do this because _nodes can also declare additional state channels_ as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the PrivateState schema is defined, so we can add bar as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bReducers\\nReducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the State. Each key in the State has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer:\\n\\u200bDefault Reducer\\nThese two examples show how to use the default reducer:\\nExample ACopyAsk AIfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    foo: int\\n    bar: list[str]\\n\\nIn this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let’s assume the input to the graph is:\\n{\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let’s then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"bye\"]}\\nExample BCopyAsk AIfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom operator import add\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    foo: int\\n    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]\\n\\nIn this example, we’ve used the Annotated type to specify a reducer function (operator.add) for the second key (bar). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let’s assume the input to the graph is {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. Let’s then assume the first Node returns {\"foo\": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\"]}. If the second node returns {\"bar\": [\"bye\"]} then the State would then be {\"foo\": 2, \"bar\": [\"hi\", \"bye\"]}. Notice here that the bar key is updated by adding the two lists together.\\n\\u200bOverwrite\\nIn some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the Overwrite type for this purpose. Learn how to use Overwrite here.\\n\\u200bWorking with Messages in Graph State\\n\\u200bWhy use messages?\\nMost modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain’s chat model interface in particular accepts a list of message objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as HumanMessage (user input) or AIMessage (LLM response).\\nTo read more about what message objects are, please refer to the Messages conceptual guide.\\n\\u200bUsing Messages in your Graph\\nIn many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of Message objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see messages key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of Message objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don’t specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use operator.add as a reducer.\\nHowever, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use operator.add, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt add_messages function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.\\n\\u200bSerialization\\nIn addition to keeping track of message IDs, the add_messages function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain Message objects whenever a state update is received on the messages channel.\\nSee more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization here. This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format:\\nCopyAsk AI# this is supported\\n{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"message\")]}\\n\\n# and this is also supported\\n{\"messages\": [{\"type\": \"human\", \"content\": \"message\"}]}\\n\\nSince the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain Messages when using add_messages, you should use dot notation to access message attributes, like state[\"messages\"][-1].content.\\nBelow is an example of a graph that uses add_messages as its reducer function.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain.messages import AnyMessage\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nclass GraphState(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\\n\\n\\u200bMessagesState\\nSince having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called MessagesState which makes it easy to use messages. MessagesState is defined with a single messages key which is a list of AnyMessage objects and uses the add_messages reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import MessagesState\\n\\nclass State(MessagesState):\\n    documents: list[str]\\n\\n\\u200bNodes\\nIn LangGraph, nodes are Python functions (either synchronous or asynchronous) that accept the following arguments:\\n\\nstate – The state of the graph\\nconfig – A RunnableConfig object that contains configuration information like thread_id and tracing information like tags\\nruntime – A Runtime object that contains runtime context and other information like store and stream_writer\\n\\nSimilar to NetworkX, you add these nodes to a graph using the add_node method:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    input: str\\n    results: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Context:\\n    user_id: str\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\ndef plain_node(state: State):\\n    return state\\n\\ndef node_with_runtime(state: State, runtime: Runtime[Context]):\\n    print(\"In node: \", runtime.context.user_id)\\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state[\\'input\\']}!\"}\\n\\ndef node_with_config(state: State, config: RunnableConfig):\\n    print(\"In node with thread_id: \", config[\"configurable\"][\"thread_id\"])\\n    return {\"results\": f\"Hello, {state[\\'input\\']}!\"}\\n\\n\\nbuilder.add_node(\"plain_node\", plain_node)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_with_runtime\", node_with_runtime)\\nbuilder.add_node(\"node_with_config\", node_with_config)\\n...\\n\\nBehind the scenes, functions are converted to RunnableLambda, which add batch and async support to your function, along with native tracing and debugging.\\nIf you add a node to a graph without specifying a name, it will be given a default name equivalent to the function name.\\nCopyAsk AIbuilder.add_node(my_node)\\n# You can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `\"my_node\"`\\n\\n\\u200bSTART Node\\nThe START Node is a special node that represents the node that sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to determine which nodes should be called first.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import START\\n\\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\\n\\n\\u200bEND Node\\nThe END Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import END\\n\\ngraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", END)\\n\\n\\u200bNode Caching\\nLangGraph supports caching of tasks/nodes based on the input to the node. To use caching:\\n\\nSpecify a cache when compiling a graph (or specifying an entrypoint)\\nSpecify a cache policy for nodes. Each cache policy supports:\\n\\nkey_func used to generate a cache key based on the input to a node, which defaults to a hash of the input with pickle.\\nttl, the time to live for the cache in seconds. If not specified, the cache will never expire.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example:\\nCopyAsk AIimport time\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.cache.memory import InMemoryCache\\nfrom langgraph.types import CachePolicy\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    x: int\\n    result: int\\n\\n\\nbuilder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n\\ndef expensive_node(state: State) -> dict[str, int]:\\n    # expensive computation\\n    time.sleep(2)\\n    return {\"result\": state[\"x\"] * 2}\\n\\n\\nbuilder.add_node(\"expensive_node\", expensive_node, cache_policy=CachePolicy(ttl=3))\\nbuilder.set_entry_point(\"expensive_node\")\\nbuilder.set_finish_point(\"expensive_node\")\\n\\ngraph = builder.compile(cache=InMemoryCache())\\n\\nprint(graph.invoke({\"x\": 5}, stream_mode=\\'updates\\'))    \\n# [{\\'expensive_node\\': {\\'result\\': 10}}]\\nprint(graph.invoke({\"x\": 5}, stream_mode=\\'updates\\'))    \\n# [{\\'expensive_node\\': {\\'result\\': 10}, \\'__metadata__\\': {\\'cached\\': True}}]\\n\\n\\nFirst run takes two seconds to run (due to mocked expensive computation).\\nSecond run utilizes cache and returns quickly.\\n\\n\\u200bEdges\\nEdges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\\n\\nNormal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\\nConditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\\nEntry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives.\\nConditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives.\\n\\nA node can have multiple outgoing edges. If a node has multiple outgoing edges, all of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\\n\\u200bNormal Edges\\nIf you always want to go from node A to node B, you can use the add_edge method directly.\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")\\n\\n\\u200bConditional Edges\\nIf you want to optionally route to one or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the add_conditional_edges method. This method accepts the name of a node and a “routing function” to call after that node is executed:\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function)\\n\\nSimilar to nodes, the routing_function accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value.\\nBy default, the return value routing_function is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function’s output to the name of the next node.\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\\n\\nUse Command instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function.\\n\\u200bEntry point\\nThe entry point is the first node(s) that are run when the graph starts. You can use the add_edge method from the virtual START node to the first node to execute to specify where to enter the graph.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import START\\n\\ngraph.add_edge(START, \"node_a\")\\n\\n\\u200bConditional entry point\\nA conditional entry point lets you start at different nodes depending on custom logic. You can use add_conditional_edges from the virtual START node to accomplish this.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.graph import START\\n\\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function)\\n\\nYou can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function’s output to the name of the next node.\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function, {True: \"node_b\", False: \"node_c\"})\\n\\n\\u200bSend\\nBy default, Nodes and Edges are defined ahead of time and operate on the same shared state. However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of State to exist at the same time. A common example of this is with map-reduce design patterns. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may want to apply some other node to all those objects. The number of objects may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object).\\nTo support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning Send objects from conditional edges. Send takes two arguments: first is the name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node.\\nCopyAsk AIdef continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):\\n    return [Send(\"generate_joke\", {\"subject\": s}) for s in state[\\'subjects\\']]\\n\\ngraph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", continue_to_jokes)\\n\\n\\u200bCommand\\nIt can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:\\nCopyAsk AIdef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\\n    return Command(\\n        # state update\\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\\n        # control flow\\n        goto=\"my_other_node\"\\n    )\\n\\nWith Command you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to conditional edges):\\nCopyAsk AIdef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\\n    if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\":\\n        return Command(update={\"foo\": \"baz\"}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\\n\\nWhen returning Command in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that my_node can navigate to my_other_node.\\nCheck out this how-to guide for an end-to-end example of how to use Command.\\n\\u200bWhen should I use Command instead of conditional edges?\\n\\nUse Command when you need to both update the graph state and route to a different node. For example, when implementing multi-agent handoffs where it’s important to route to a different agent and pass some information to that agent.\\nUse conditional edges to route between nodes conditionally without updating the state.\\n\\n\\u200bNavigating to a node in a parent graph\\nIf you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:\\nCopyAsk AIdef my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"other_subgraph\"]]:\\n    return Command(\\n        update={\"foo\": \"bar\"},\\n        goto=\"other_subgraph\",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph\\n        graph=Command.PARENT\\n    )\\n\\nSetting graph to Command.PARENT will navigate to the closest parent graph.When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that’s shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you’re updating in the parent graph state. See this example.\\nThis is particularly useful when implementing multi-agent handoffs.\\nCheck out this guide for detail.\\n\\u200bUsing inside tools\\nA common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation.\\nRefer to this guide for detail.\\n\\u200bHuman-in-the-loop\\nCommand is an important part of human-in-the-loop workflows: when using interrupt() to collect user input, Command is then used to supply the input and resume execution via Command(resume=\"User input\"). Check out this conceptual guide for more information.\\n\\u200bGraph migrations\\nLangGraph can easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when using a checkpointer to track state.\\n\\nFor threads at the end of the graph (i.e. not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes and edges, remove, add, rename, etc)\\nFor threads currently interrupted, we support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) — if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\\nFor modifying state, we have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys\\nState keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads\\nState keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads with state from before the change — if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.\\n\\n\\u200bRuntime context\\nWhen creating a graph, you can specify a context_schema for runtime context passed to nodes. This is useful for passing\\ninformation to nodes that is not part of the graph state. For example, you might want to pass dependencies such as model name or a database connection.\\nCopyAsk AI@dataclass\\nclass ContextSchema:\\n    llm_provider: str = \"openai\"\\n\\ngraph = StateGraph(State, context_schema=ContextSchema)\\n\\nYou can then pass this context into the graph using the context parameter of the invoke method.\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.invoke(inputs, context={\"llm_provider\": \"anthropic\"})\\n\\nYou can then access and use this context inside a node or conditional edge:\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.runtime import Runtime\\n\\ndef node_a(state: State, runtime: Runtime[ContextSchema]):\\n    llm = get_llm(runtime.context.llm_provider)\\n    # ...\\n\\nSee this guide for a full breakdown on configuration.\\n\\u200bRecursion limit\\nThe recursion limit sets the maximum number of super-steps the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise GraphRecursionError. By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to invoke/stream via the config dictionary. Importantly, recursion_limit is a standalone config key and should not be passed inside the configurable key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below:\\nCopyAsk AIgraph.invoke(inputs, config={\"recursion_limit\": 5}, context={\"llm\": \"anthropic\"})\\n\\nRead this how-to to learn more about how the recursion limit works.\\n\\u200bAccessing and handling the recursion counter\\nThe current step counter is accessible in config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"] within any node, allowing for proactive recursion handling before hitting the recursion limit. This enables you to implement graceful degradation strategies within your graph logic.\\n\\u200bHow it works\\nThe step counter is stored in config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]. The recursion limit check follows the logic: step > stop where stop = step + recursion_limit + 1. When the limit is exceeded, LangGraph raises a GraphRecursionError.\\n\\u200bAccessing the current step counter\\nYou can access the current step counter within any node to monitor execution progress.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\n\\ndef my_node(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> dict:\\n    current_step = config[\"metadata\"][\"langgraph_step\"]\\n    print(f\"Currently on step: {current_step}\")\\n    return state\\n\\n\\u200bProactive recursion handling\\nYou can check the step counter and proactively route to a different node before hitting the limit.

Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.\\nThe Functional API uses two key building blocks:\\n\\n@entrypoint – Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\\n@task – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.\\n\\nThis provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.\\nFor information on how to use the functional API, see Use Functional API.\\n\\u200bFunctional API vs. Graph API\\nFor users who prefer a more declarative approach, LangGraph’s Graph API allows you to define workflows using a Graph paradigm. Both APIs share the same underlying runtime, so you can use them together in the same application.\\nHere are some key differences:\\n\\nControl flow: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows. This will usually trim the amount of code you need to write.\\nShort-term memory: The GraphAPI requires declaring a State and may require defining reducers to manage updates to the graph state. @entrypoint and @tasks do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.\\nCheckpointing: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the Graph API a new checkpoint is generated after every superstep. In the Functional API, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.\\nVisualization: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others. The Functional API does not support visualization as the graph is dynamically generated during runtime.\\n\\n\\u200bExample\\nBelow we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and interrupts to request human review.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\\n\\n@task\\ndef write_essay(topic: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Write an essay about the given topic.\"\"\"\\n    time.sleep(1) # A placeholder for a long-running task.\\n    return f\"An essay about topic: {topic}\"\\n\\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\\ndef workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\\n    \"\"\"A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review.\"\"\"\\n    essay = write_essay(\"cat\").result()\\n    is_approved = interrupt({\\n        # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.\\n        # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data\\n        # from the workflow.\\n        \"essay\": essay, # The essay we want reviewed.\\n        # We can add any additional information that we need.\\n        # For example, introduce a key called \"action\" with some instructions.\\n        \"action\": \"Please approve/reject the essay\",\\n    })\\n\\n    return {\\n        \"essay\": essay, # The essay that was generated\\n        \"is_approved\": is_approved, # Response from HIL\\n    }\\n\\nDetailed ExplanationThis workflow will write an essay about the topic “cat” and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the writeEssay task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.CopyAsk AIimport time\\nimport uuid\\nfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint, task\\nfrom langgraph.types import interrupt\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\\n\\n\\n@task\\ndef write_essay(topic: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Write an essay about the given topic.\"\"\"\\n    time.sleep(1)  # This is a placeholder for a long-running task.\\n    return f\"An essay about topic: {topic}\"\\n\\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())\\ndef workflow(topic: str) -> dict:\\n    \"\"\"A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review.\"\"\"\\n    essay = write_essay(\"cat\").result()\\n    is_approved = interrupt(\\n        {\\n            # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.\\n            # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data\\n            # from the workflow.\\n            \"essay\": essay,  # The essay we want reviewed.\\n            # We can add any additional information that we need.\\n            # For example, introduce a key called \"action\" with some instructions.\\n            \"action\": \"Please approve/reject the essay\",\\n        }\\n    )\\n    return {\\n        \"essay\": essay,  # The essay that was generated\\n        \"is_approved\": is_approved,  # Response from HIL\\n    }\\n\\n\\nthread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": thread_id}}\\nfor item in workflow.stream(\"cat\", config):\\n    print(item)\\n# > {\\'write_essay\\': \\'An essay about topic: cat\\'}\\n# > {\\n# >     \\'__interrupt__\\': (\\n# >        Interrupt(\\n# >            value={\\n# >                \\'essay\\': \\'An essay about topic: cat\\',\\n# >                \\'action\\': \\'Please approve/reject the essay\\'\\n# >            },\\n# >            id=\\'b9b2b9d788f482663ced6dc755c9e981\\'\\n# >        ),\\n# >    )\\n# > }\\nAn essay has been written and is ready for review.

It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\\n\\u200bDefinition\\nAn entrypoint is defined by decorating a function with the @entrypoint decorator.\\nThe function must accept a single positional argument, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.\\nDecorating a function with an entrypoint produces a Pregel instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).\\nYou will usually want to pass a checkpointer to the @entrypoint decorator to enable persistence and use features like human-in-the-loop.\\n Sync AsyncCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\\n\\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\\ndef my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:\\n    # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,\\n    # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop.\\n    ...\\n    return result\\n\\nSerialization\\nThe inputs and outputs of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.

It has two key characteristics:\\n\\nAsynchronous Execution: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.\\nCheckpointing: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See persistence for more details).\\n\\n\\u200bDefinition\\nTasks are defined using the @task decorator, which wraps a regular Python function.\\nCopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.func import task\\n\\n@task()\\ndef slow_computation(input_value):\\n    # Simulate a long-running operation\\n    ...\\n    return result\\n\\nSerialization\\nThe outputs of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.\\n\\u200bExecution\\nTasks can only be called from within an entrypoint, another task, or a state graph node.\\nTasks cannot be called directly from the main application code.\\nWhen you call a task, it returns immediately with a future object. A future is a placeholder for a result that will be available later.\\nTo obtain the result of a task, you can either wait for it synchronously (using result()) or await it asynchronously (using await).\\n Synchronous Invocation Asynchronous InvocationCopyAsk AI@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\\ndef my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:\\n    future = slow_computation(some_input)\\n    return future.result()  # Wait for the result synchronously\\n\\n\\u200bWhen to use a task\\nTasks are useful in the following scenarios:\\n\\nCheckpointing: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don’t need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.\\nHuman-in-the-loop: If you’re building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use tasks to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the determinism section for more details.\\nParallel Execution: For I/O-bound tasks, tasks enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).\\nObservability: Wrapping operations in tasks provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using LangSmith.\\nRetryable Work: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, tasks provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.\\n\\n\\u200bSerialization\\nThere are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:\\n\\nentrypoint inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.\\ntask outputs must be JSON-serializable.\\n\\nThese requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use python primitives like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.\\nSerialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.\\nProviding non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.\\n\\u200bDeterminism\\nTo utilize features like human-in-the-loop, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of tasks. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same sequence of steps, even if task results are non-deterministic.\\nLangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting task and subgraph results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the same sequence of steps, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running tasks or tasks with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.\\nWhile different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a specific run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up task and subgraph results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.\\n\\u200bIdempotency\\nIdempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside tasks functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a task starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the task will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.\\n\\u200bCommon Pitfalls\\n\\u200bHandling side effects\\nEncapsulate side effects (e.g., writing to a file, sending an email) in tasks to ensure they are not executed multiple times when resuming a workflow.\\n Incorrect CorrectIn this example, a side effect (writing to a file) is directly included in the workflow, so it will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.CopyAsk AI@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\\ndef my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\\n    # This code will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.\\n    # Which is likely not what you want.\\n    with open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as f:  \\n        f.write(\"Side effect executed\")  \\n    value = interrupt(\"question\")\\n    return value\\n\\n\\u200bNon-deterministic control flow\\nOperations that might give different results each time (like getting current time or random numbers) should be encapsulated in tasks to ensure that on resume, the same result is returned.\\n\\nIn a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → (returns 5 again) → …\\nNot in a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → get new random number (7) → …\\n\\nThis is especially important when using human-in-the-loop workflows with multiple interrupts calls. LangGraph keeps a list of resume values for each task/entrypoint. When an interrupt is encountered, it’s matched with the corresponding resume value. This matching is strictly index-based, so the order of the resume values should match the order of the interrupts.\\nIf order of execution is not maintained when resuming, one interrupt call may be matched with the wrong resume value, leading to incorrect results.\\nPlease read the section on determinism for more details.\\n Incorrect CorrectIn this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.CopyAsk AIfrom langgraph.func import entrypoint\\n\\n@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)\\ndef my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:\\n    t0 = inputs[\"t0\"]\\n    t1 = time.time()  \\n\\n    delta_t = t1 - t0\\n\\n    if delta_t > 1:\\n        result = slow_task(1).result()\\n        value = interrupt(\"question\")\\n    else:\\n        result = slow_task(2).result()\\n        value = interrupt(\"question\")\\n\\n    return {\\n        \"result\": result,\\n        \"value\": value\\n    }\\n\\n\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\nConnect these docs programmatically to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for    real-time answers.Was this page helpful?YesNoUse the graph APIPreviousUse the functional APINext⌘IDocs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesForumChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify')]"

       "  Document(metadata={}, page_content='Whether you are an avid cake baker or a complete baking newbie, you´ll definitely come across a lot of different ways in which cake making methods are described. There are all-in-one recipes, and cakes that are made by the creaming method, the melting method, or the melted method! But what do all of these things mean, where are the pitfalls and what are some useful tricks for you to master them all?! [...] The third cake making method is all about the eggs! Whisked eggs are often the only raising agents in cakes using the whisked method, so incorporating enough air when whisking the eggs is absolutely crucial for a good rise! The whisked method, in my opinion, is a really good method to make light and airy sponges, that can be used in a large range of recipes of varying difficulties (see below). [...] The all-in-one method is arguably the best cake making method out there! Not only is it super easy to follow, but it is pretty much fail-proof! As the name suggests, in this method all the ingredients are added to the mixing bowl at once and combined to make a thick, smooth, batter.\\nThere are so many ways to mix up cake batter. Maybe you\\'ve always wondered why the many methods; maybe you never thought about it until now. But each technique is based on specific ingredients, and results in a different final product: from a light as air cake, to one that\\'s sturdy enough to hold up in wedding tiers.\\n\\nCommon ways you might see cake mixing methods written in a recipe:\\n\\n\"Cream the butter and sugar together.\"\\n\\n\"Combine dry ingredients. Add butter and mix until it resembles sand.\" [...] Sponge cakes can be made different ways. One way is beating egg yolks and sugar (or whole eggs and sugar) until a very thick foam-like batter is created. The batter is pale yellow in color, and falls off the beater in ribbons. Flour is then gently folded in.\\n\\nAnother way is to whip the egg whites separately from the yolks until soft peaks form. The yolk/sugar mixture is beaten until light, flour is mixed in, and then egg whites are gently folded into that mixture. [...] Cakes made with this method: Extremely light and airy. This high-rising, somewhat \"resilient\" cake slices best with a serrated knife or pronged angel food cutter.\\n\\nThe leanest cake in the bunch, foam cakes contain little to no fat: i.e. no butter or shortening, and no egg yolks.\\noil-based cake is to combine all of the dry ingredients, then all of the wet ingredients, then mix the two together until smooth. It\\'s important to note for chocolate cakes, you\\'re almost always going to want to bloom the cocoa powder with hot water separate from the rest of the ingredients. And then you will mix this into your wet ingredients later. This cake method is incredibly quick and easy, especially for beginner bakers. It makes a very moist cake that will stay soft even after being in [...] up on the screen or I\\'ll put a link in the description box as well. This delicious layer cake is going to be filled with a cinnamon pecan strusel and covered in a cinnamon cream cheese buttercream that is just to die for. Then we\\'re going to top it with a white chocolate drip, some piping, and of course, more cinnamon pecan strusel. The creaming method is an incredibly versatile method for making delicious cakes and cupcakes. If you want to see some of my favorite creaming method recipes, check [...] my batter into my prepared cake pans, I like to even it out with a small offset spatula. But then here\\'s my little secret. I use a skewer to gently wiggle it through the cake in one direction, then the other. This will remove any air pockets that might be hiding out from when I put my batter in the pan, and it further helps level out the cake batter. Now, these vanilla cake layers that we just baked together are for my coffee cake layer cake. You can watch a video tutorial for that whole cake\\nNo matter what size or brand cake pan you use, make sure you prepare it appropriately. These days I ALWAYS use parchment paper rounds. Trace the bottom of the cake pans(s) on a large piece of parchment paper. Cut out the parchment circle(s). Then, very lightly grease the cake pans with butter or nonstick spray. I usually use coconut oil nonstick spray or “baking spray” which has a little flour in it. Place the parchment round inside, then grease the parchment round too. Yes, grease the pan AND [...] When the cake has cooled, run a thin knife around the edge, invert the cake on your hand or work surface, then pull off the cake pan. Peel off the parchment round.\\n\\nIf you’re serving the cake right out of the pan, such as a sheet cake, no need to line with parchment. (Though you certainly could if desired.) Just grease the pan.\\nMost of the cakes I personally make are butter-based cakes. They’re generally the easiest cake recipes and are made by creaming the butter and sugar together to create air pockets that contribute to the fluffiness of cake. Butter is a common fat in cakes (but your eggs also provide fat) that not only provides a lot of flavor but holds air bubbles in the batter that creates the proper texture for the cake. It reacts with the gluten in flour to coat the molecules and prevent them from combining')]}"
